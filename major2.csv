COM EM 700,Introduction to Emerging Media Studies,"Drawing on scientific research and relevant news & industry examples this course  will examine topics related to new media and communication technologies. The  first portion of the course will explore key dimensions related to new  communication technology. The latter portion will include deep dives into  particular media technologies (ranging from smart phones and laptops to newer,  emerging media formats such as social games, mobile virtual reality, and  wearable sensors), each characterized to varying extents by these dimensions.  Throughout the course we will explore relevant theoretical concepts and  processes related to new media and communication technologies. Along the way we  will identify patterns of media usage and, in turn, review the psychological  effects and social consequences of that usage. Additionally, we will consider  the larger context in which these technologies -- and the means for empirically  studying their use and effects -- have developed.",None,None,4,https://www.bu.edu//academics/com/courses/com-em-700/
COM EM 747,Trending Insights: Social Data Analysis and Visualization,"This course familiarizes students with social -scientific methods for large  scale data analysis and visualization, including the application of relevant  user and concept networks, time and spatial models, sentiment mapping, and  comparison of matrices.  In addition, the use of germane software in emerging  and digital media research is developed.  Most importantly, however, this course  has a dual structure where students learn to not only carry our advanced  analyses of large datasets, they also engage with how to visually represent with  a wide-ranging skillset to scrape data, mine data, and present data in fields of  specific areas of inquiry.",None,None,4,https://www.bu.edu//academics/com/courses/com-em-747/

Our work  here situates  the changing nature of networks in media from broadcast  network models to social network ones.   As such, it is both historically  informed and theoretically inclusive.  An important component of  study also  incorporates an immersive social network experience as part of this class,  which is to  say that the class becomes its own online social network and  students are peer collaborators.",None,None,4,https://www.bu.edu//academics/com/courses/com-em-797/
