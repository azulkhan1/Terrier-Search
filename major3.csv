COM FT 556,American Independent Film-Part 1 The Foundational Masterworks,"The course comprises one unit of a four-semester survey (each part of which is free-standing and may be taken separately and independently of each other and in any order, with no prerequisites) of the major achievements of the most important artistic movement of the last sixty years in American film--the independent feature filmmaking movement, in which American narrative filmmakers broke away from the financial, bureaucratic, and (most importantly) imaginative influence of Hollywood values and entertainment story-telling methods to create the most important works in American film--a series of generally low-tech, low-budget, DIY, personal-expression films, made and distributed more or less outside the mainstream exhibition system. This section of the survey focuses on the foundational masterworks created by the first generation of American independent feature filmmakers. These are the works that not only changed film history at the point they were made but that continue to inspire generations of independent filmmakers with their example. Since women have made some of the best and most important works in this area, as many female filmmakers as possible are being included. Offered in the fall of odd numbered years.

Using the framework of television studies in conversation with religious  studies, Religion and Television analyzes religion as: a tradition, as a  grouping of tropes and stories, a functional part of lived experience, a  component of identity, a structure of sociocultural power, and a discourse with  specific cultural assumptions attached to it. These televisual articulations of  religion are shaped by television's history, ideology, industry, culture, and  reception.
